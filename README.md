Travel Booking System Using Java
An Online Travel Booking System built with Java and Servlets is a dynamic web application designed to facilitate flight or hotel reservations. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, using JSP (JavaServer Pages) for the user interface (View) and Servlets for server-side processing and business logic (Controller).

The system connects to a database (e.g., MySQL) to manage user profiles, travel schedules, and booking history. Key features typically include user authentication, real-time search filtering, and booking confirmation handling. This project demonstrates how to manage HTTP requests, session tracking, and database connectivity (JDBC) in a secure, scalable environment.
